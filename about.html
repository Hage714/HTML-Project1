<h8>Our promise - valuing the inspiration ...</h8>
<br><br>
<h9>"Share the beauty of Africa with the world through luxury fashion in an ethical way"</h9>
<p>From the moment our first blazer was stitched, we made a promise to give 20% of profits to projects within Kenyan communities, helping the people, the place and the wildlife.We therefore aim to give back to the society in the most interesting way</p>
<p>Africa has so much to offer and while many choose to give back to it, there are some who sadly choose to exploit it. It is our promise to value what this stunning continent has given us.It was a dream of ours to show the world Kenya’s bright and beautiful culture in an empowering and luxury way.</p>

<h3>Our Founder</h3>
<div class="founder">
  <img class="img3" src="Images/hij3.jpg">
  <p id="founder-text">Mo started her journey in the fashion industry as an Image Consultant but shortly after, transitioned to fashion design. She showed her first high fashion collection at Lagos Fashion Week (LFW), earning online coverage from renowned brands like Vogue and Women’s Wear Daily (WWD).

    While maintaining a love and respect for luxury fashion, she noticed a gap in the market for brands that cater specifically to black and brown women, especially ones like herself who have unconventional body proportions, and she launched M.O.T to fill that gap. The brand now serves customers in over 20 countries.
    
    Her passion for human capital development has played a role in determining her approach to building M.O.T; keeping all functions of the business in-house- across design, marketing, manufacturing and retail.
    
    Mo has a deep love and appreciation for art, food, architecture, decor and music. She is passionate about elevating the work of African creatives and creators; and developing the Nigerian fashion industry.
